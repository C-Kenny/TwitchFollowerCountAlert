TwitchFollowerCountAlert 
========================
Linux only (currently)

**Author:** Carl Kenny | csk29@uclive.ac.nz

**Prog:** Console script that alerts user when the desired twitch channel surpasses n
followers. Is extremely useful for competitions where the streamer
announces that they will giveaway a prize at n followers *The API only allows 100 calls at a time, so if there are a lot of followers,
this may take some serious time to process (maybe even minutes!).

**Usage:** `python3 twitch_followers_count.py`
