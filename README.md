**Prog:** Console script that alerts user when the desired twitch channel surpasses n
followers. Is extremely useful for competitions where the streamer
announces that they will giveaway a prize at n followers.

Now offers basic ability to get follower count from a channel's description. For example, on my test channel: " github test. giveaway at 10k followers" will obtain the number 10 then multiply it by a thousand. Then waiti for the channel to hit 10 000 followers. 


I've created an example channel to test the script on here: http://www.twitch.tv/ck_ck_ck

**Usage:** `python3 twitch_followers_count.py`
